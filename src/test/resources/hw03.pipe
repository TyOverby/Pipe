|list 1.

    Comparing functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$:
    |list (a)
      |item
        $f(n) = 2^n, g(n) = 2^(n/2)$

        $f(n) = :omega(g(n))$:

        |equation =
          !limit(n, :infty) (f(n))/(g(n)) = !limit(n, :infty) (2^n)/(2^(n/2))
                                          = !limit(n, :infty) 2^(n/2)
                                          = :infty.
      |item
        $f(n) = e^n, g(n) = n2^n$
        $f(n) = :omega(g(n))$:
        |equation =
          !limit(n, :infty) (f(n))/(g(n)) = !limit(n, :infty) (e^n)/(n2^n)
                                          = !limit(n, :infty) (1)/(n) ((e)/(2))^n
                                          = (1 - :ln(2)) !limit(n, :infty) ((e)/(2))^n
                                          = :infty.
      |item
        $f(n) = n^(!sqrt(n)), g(n) = 2^(an)$
        $f(n) = o(g(n))$: consider the following inequality:
        |equation :leq
          n^(!sqrt(n)) :leq 2^(an)
          :log(n^(!sqrt(n))) :leq :log(2^(an))
          !sqrt(n) :log(n) :leq a n :log(2)
          n^(-1/2) :log(n) :leq a :log(2)
        Taking the limit of the left-hand side as $n :to :infty$, we find
        |equation =
          !limit(n, :infty) n^(-1/2) :log(n) = !limit(n, :infty) (:log(n))/(n^(1/2))
                                             = !limit(n, :infty) (1/n)/((1/2)n^(-1/2))
                                             = !limit(n, :infty) 2n^(-1/2)
                                             = 0.
        As $n$ grows large, the left-hand side tends to zero while the right-hand side remains a positive constant. So we have shown that $n^(!sqrt(n)) = O(2^(an))$. Conversely, if the inequality were reversed it would not hold for large $n$, even with the addition of a positive constant. It follows that $n^(!sqrt(n)) :not= :Omega(2^(an))$, so we must have $n^(!sqrt(n)) = o(2^(an))$.
