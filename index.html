Vulcan is a markup language focusing on simplicity that compiles down to LaTeX.
The main goal of Vulcan is to remove as much boilerplate and non-essential markup
as possible, leaving you with source files that look remarkably like their generated
output.

<h1> Hello Vulcan </h1>

<p>
Getting some simple text on screen is a common exercise when it comes to learning
a new programming language.  Let's do that now.  Open up your text editor of choice
and type in the following bit of text:
</p>

<pre><!-- hello.vlcn -->
Hello World
</pre>

<p>
Running this example through Vulcan and then through pdflatex will yield a document
only containing the contents "Hello World".
</p>

<p>
Ok, now for some of the stuff that we're good at.  As part of Vulcan, we've built in
a smart mathematical typesetting mode.  Unlike LaTeX, we use modern programming language
techniques to take a formula that you might type into a graphing calculator and lay it out
on screen.  Let's see that in action.
